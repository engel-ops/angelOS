### Intel Virtualization Technology

> Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) allows one hardware platform to function as multiple “virtual” platforms. It offers improved manageability by limiting downtime and maintaining productivity by isolating computing activities into separate partitions.

> This allows an operating system to more effectively & efficiently utilize the CPU power in the computer so that it runs faster. This feature is also a requirement for many virtual machine software and is required to be enabled in order for them to run properly or even at all.

### Legacy USB Support

InsydeH20 UEFI does not natively support USB, the `Legacy USB Support` option enables the possibility to make USB devices available during boot e.g. for a flashed installation ISO on an USB flash drive.
